# 🚀 Customer Churn Prediction ML Project

An End-to-End Machine Learning project to predict whether a telecom customer is likely to churn or continue using the service.

This project covers the complete Machine Learning lifecycle:

✅ Data Analysis  
✅ Data Cleaning  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis  
✅ Feature Engineering  
✅ Model Training  
✅ Model Evaluation  
✅ Model Deployment  
✅ Real-Time Prediction using Streamlit  


# 📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges faced by subscription-based companies.

The main objective of this project is to build a Machine Learning model that can predict whether a customer will leave the telecom service based on customer demographics, service usage, contract details, and billing information.

The trained model is deployed using Streamlit to provide real-time churn predictions.


# 🎯 Business Problem

Telecom companies lose customers due to:

- Poor customer experience
- Pricing issues
- Competition
- Service problems

Predicting customer churn helps companies to:

- Identify customers who may leave
- Improve customer retention
- Provide personalized offers
- Reduce revenue loss
- Make better business decisions

# 🔄 Machine Learning Workflow


## 1. Data Loading

Loaded telecom customer churn dataset using Pandas.


## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed:

✅ Dataset shape analysis  
✅ Column analysis  
✅ Data type checking  
✅ Missing value detection  
✅ Duplicate checking  
✅ Churn distribution analysis  
✅ Numerical feature analysis  
✅ Categorical feature analysis  
✅ Correlation analysis  
✅ Outlier detection  


## 3. Data Preprocessing

Performed following steps:

- Converted TotalCharges into numerical format
- Removed unnecessary customerID column
- Handled missing values
- Separated features and target variable
- Applied One-Hot Encoding
- Performed train-test split
- Prepared dataset for Machine Learning


## 4. Model Training

Multiple Machine Learning algorithms were trained:

### Logistic Regression

Used as baseline classification model.


### Decision Tree Classifier

Used to capture non-linear patterns.


### Random Forest Classifier

Selected as final model because of better performance and stability.
